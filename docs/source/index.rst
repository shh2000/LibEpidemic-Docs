Welcome to LibEpidemic's documentation!
===================================

**LibEpidemic** 
is an open source modeling framework, 
built in python, designed to help researchers, epidemiologists,
 teachers, and students research and learn content related to infectious disease modeling.

We provide a complete modeling engine for building compartment models of any form, 
complete parameter configuration and reloading mechanisms to implement dynamic parameters, 
and even meta-population models. Through this unified engine, 
researchers can quickly and easily build their own infectious disease models, 
focusing more on solving epidemiological problems and designing experiments rather than writing low-level code.


Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
