BRICS-STI FRAMEWORK PROGRAMM
------------

`BRICS-STI <http://brics-sti.org/>`_

In July 2015 representatives of the BRICS funding agencies for the first time jointly sat together in Moscow and discussed an idea to launch a multilateral programme that should focus on support of joint research projects within BRICS. Activities on drafting of the architecture for the future cooperation programme and elaboration of statutory documents began as a follow up of the meeting. As a result of the work done, creation of the BRICS STI Framework Programme was endorsed in October 2015 at the meeting of the BRICS Ministers for Science and Technology. The BRICS STI Funding Working Group was also created in order to formalize meetings of the BRICS research funding agencies that would establish and govern BRICS STI FP.

EpiModeling Project under BRICS-STI
----------------

`Epimodeling <https://epimodeling.work/#/>`_

This is a project under BRICS-STI Framework, using modeling techniques to research COVID-19.

BIGSCity lab of Beihang University
----------------

The BIGSCITY group is committed to the research on the intersection of machine learning and data mining in urban science, social science and other fields. BIGSCITY's research interests include: urban computing, spatiotemporal data mining, machine learning interpretability, and applications of AI in transportation, health, finance, and other fields.

Epidemic Prediction Platform Integrating Big Data
----------------

`COVID-19 report <https://covid19-report.com/>`_

researchers use BD-SUEIR epidemic model to predict and simulate COVID-19 worldwide. BD-SUEIR model is constucted under LibEpidemic.

Paperlist for determining the research plan for this project
----------------

`Paperlist <https://github.com/Bigscity-epidemic/Bigscity-epidemic-survey-paperlist>`_

By reading and summarizing many papers in Nature, Science, PNAS, AAAI, TKDE, KDD, and summarizing the research on the traditional warehouse model in the paper, this study summarizes five main ways to improve the classic compartment model. , which are horizontal compartment subdivision, vertical compartment subdivision, adding dynamic equations/transfer pathways, parameter dynamization, and improvements based on different propagation architectures. Among them, the first three schemes correspond to the warehouse expansion function, and the latter two correspond to the external data definition and import functions. While investigating and researching, this study fulfills these requirements and tries to establish a unified big data infectious disease modeling framework.
