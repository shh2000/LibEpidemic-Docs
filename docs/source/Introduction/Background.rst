LibEpidemic is an open source modeling framework, 
built in python, designed to help researchers, epidemiologists, teachers, 
and students whose research and learn related to infectious disease modeling.

We provide a complete modeling engine for building warehouse models of any shape, 
complete parameter configuration and reloading mechanisms to implement dynamic parameters, 
and even meta-population models. Through this unified engine, 
researchers can quickly and easily build their own infectious disease models, 
focusing more on solving epidemiological problems and designing experiments rather than writing low-level code.

In order to achieve the above goals, 
LibEpidemic has built an engine-model-application three-level framework, 
which provides users with different levels of freedom and support for different purposes. Their functions are:

* engine: build any model with any parameters, learn everything in LibEpidemic
* model: build specific model with any parameters or settings, learn upper APi in LibEpidemic
* applications: use NPI or MedRes model to solve epidemiological problem, learn basic grammar of python is enough!

Also, this open source framework has also received project support and design guidance from BRICS, 
Beihang University and other organizations or universities. Support are provided directly or indirectly from:

The LibEpidemic is mainly developed and maintained by Beihang Interest Group on 
SmartCity (`BIGSCITY <https://www.bigcity.ai/>`_). The core developers of this library 
is `@Shhh <https://github.com/shh2000>`_).
