Research Topics
------------

This project sets up three topics, which are undertaken by research teams in China, Russia and Brazil respectively. The subject setting is carried out in accordance with the principles of vertical division and horizontal cooperation, that is, each subject covers all levels from data collection to model application to ensure the integrity and independence of the research work of all parties, thereby controlling research risks; At the level, the research content of each team has different focuses, complementing each other's advantages and avoiding repeated research.

Research Content and Cooperations
----------------

This project aims to develop a set of multi-level, multi-angle and multi-method simulation and prediction models for the new crown pneumonia epidemic through the multilateral scientific research cooperation of China, Russia and Brazil, using their respective advantageous fields. The research content of this project includes four parts: data collection, extraction of influencing factors, model establishment, and model application of the new crown pneumonia epidemic modeling, covering the entire process of the new crown epidemic model from data input to practical application.
