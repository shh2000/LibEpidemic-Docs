After the outbreak of COVID-19, the SEIR model has shown two limitations as an infectious disease model: it cannot model realastic scenarios and dynamics.

Although the SEIR model models the whole process of contact-exposure-onset-removal of the development of infectious diseases, it is too ideal for the assumptions of compartments and individuals. This is reflected in:

* Individuals in the same compartment are identical. For example, infected individuals transmit the disease to susceptible individuals at an average rate, and each individual has the same importance in the transmission chain. 
* Each individual is a "guinea pig" without subjective initiative. Individuals will not change their action strategies or formulate non-pharmacological interventions(NPIs, similarly hereinafter) according to the development of the epidemic.
* The compartment is set according to the principle of the epidemic, not the actual observation data. For example, the infected person's compartment is set, but only the confirmed data can be obtained in reality, and the error of approximate substitution is unignorable.

With increased human mobility and the introduction of NPIs, the complex, dynamic spread of COVID-19 has diverged significantly from SEIR's single, static assumption. At the same time, the ability to obtain front-line data also limits the modeling capabilities of SEIR. About 3.8 million papers have researched this limitation, here are some examples of complex scenarios and dynamics: Henrik Salje and others modeled the different age of individuals in the compartment and took into account the special propagation patterns of this scene in France, Vadim A. Karatayeva and others modeled the dynamics of the transmission rate caused by dynamics in population mobility, and conducted a simulation experiment on the effect of NPIs based on this model.
